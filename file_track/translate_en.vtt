00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000 
Music

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can remember when we walked together

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Sharing a love I thought would last forever

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Moonlight to show the way so we can follow

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then somethin' changed her mind, her kisses told me

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I had no lovin' arms to hold me

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Lonely is a man without love

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Lonely is a man without love

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Knowing that it's cloudy above

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Lonely is a man without love 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, if you see my girl please send her home to me

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Say I can't stop myself from crying

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Lonely is a man without love

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Lonely is a man without love

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Knowing that it's cloudy above

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Lonely is a man without love

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Every day I wake up, then I start to break up

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Lonely is a man without love

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Lonely is a man without love
